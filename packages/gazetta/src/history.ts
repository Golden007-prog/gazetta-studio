/**
 * History / revisions for a target.
 *
 * Every write to a target (save or publish) records a revision. Undo and
 * rollback restore a prior revision — both are soft (forward-only; create
 * a new revision reverting to the past state, never destroy history).
 *
 * Storage layout per target (all inside the target's storage, in the
 * reserved `.gazetta/` namespace that the runtime never reads):
 *
 *   .gazetta/
 *     history/
 *       index.json              ordered revision list
 *       objects/<hh>/<rest>     content-addressed blobs, sharded by first 2 hex chars
 *       revisions/<id>.json    revision manifest: metadata + item→hash map
 *
 * One uniform approach across all storage providers — the provider
 * interface remains read/write bytes at paths; no provider-native
 * versioning (S3 object versions, git commits) is used.
 *
 * This module declares the types and provider interface. Implementation
 * lands in a later phase.
